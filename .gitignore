You've made 28 API requests without a task_progress parameter. It is strongly recomended that you create one to track remaining work.


1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call
2. Review each item and update its status:
   - [x]
   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]
   - Add new items if you discover additional steps
3. Modify the list as needed:
		- Add any new steps you've discovered
		- Reorder if the sequence has changed
4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state

**Remember:** Keeping the task_progress list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
